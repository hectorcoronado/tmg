#### All code for React Fundamentals course from [TylerMcGinnis.com](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/)

#### To run locally:

`$ npm run start`

This command runs `webpack-dev-server` & opens the resulting app in `localhost:8080`

If you start getting permission denied errors, it's because github api is rate-limiting you; google how to get a client id & secret id.
